As simple as it gets. 

For any person to run this, do the following:

1.) If you have an IDE supporting Python, simply run "main.py" from it. 

The downloaded reports should appear in the folder "reports" when downloading. This is a folder you will need to create yourself.
Simply, from the IDE, create a new folder in the "W" repo, and name it "reports". 
The download will make the files download to that exact folder name.

Alternatively, you can change the target folder to your own desired path, by simply changing the value of the output_folder variable in the "main.py" script
